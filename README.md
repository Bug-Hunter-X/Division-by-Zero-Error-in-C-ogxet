# Division by Zero Bug in C

This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: division by zero. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.

The bug arises from attempting to divide an integer by zero, resulting in undefined behavior. The program might crash, or it might produce unexpected and unpredictable results.  Robust error handling is crucial to prevent such issues.

This example highlights the importance of input validation and error checking in C programs to ensure stability and reliability.
